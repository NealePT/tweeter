View of the same page with the new tweet box enabled. The "tweet" button posts the tweet, which then appears below the new tweet box without the page refreshing. Also included is a character counter that will count down to zero and into negative numbers. If the number is below zero, the tweet will not be posted and an alert will display explaining this.
